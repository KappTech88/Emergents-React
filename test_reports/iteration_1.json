All 5 sections (Tunnel, Velocity Sphere, Liquid Distortion, Exploded View, Globe) render correctly with impressive 3D effects. Scroll interactions work properly using mouse wheel. UI elements including header, scroll indicator, and Download Report button are functional. Responsive design works on mobile and tablet viewports.",
